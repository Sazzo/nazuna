Welcome to Nazuna! Looks like it's your first time that you're using me!
Before I can start, I need some Twitter credentials (API Key and API Secret).

Please, take a read at https://github.com/Sazzo/Nazuna#configuration and when you're ready, provide me the keys below!

pub const OAUTH_MESSAGE: &str = r#"
Now, I need you to authenticate using your Twitter account. I'll try to open your browser with the OAuth URL.
If this doesn't works, you can try opening the URL manually in your browser.
